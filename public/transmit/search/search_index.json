This frustrates me. It\u2019s unfair, short sighted and won\u2019t end well. Bill Gates says we need a robot tax welfare. I don\u2019t want to be on welfare. Neither does anyone I know.\n\n\nMeanwhile in the world of not rich people, here\u2019s an alternative idea: communal robots, owned by workers. For the last 18 months I've been working on this idea, but it\u2019s been pointless to talk about because with robots there\u2019s only show - not tell.\n\n\nWell this week I can show - a little:\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the alternate reality where 10 million people will own those 10 million robots - a reality where \u201cmake it close, on-demand and cheaply bespoke\u201d is an advantage for the working class. People like us!\n\n\nSo why did this bit of progress take me 18 months? Because like you, I have a day job. I work in the engine room at Autodesk. It's funny... Fusion360 and Eagle will play a key role for anyone who joins this worker-robot revolution.\n\n\nWhat you see in the video is a couple of things\n\n\nThing 1:\n a stepper motor as an Android USB type-C peripheral. It gets its data and 100W power from a standard USB cable. Btw, that\u2019s Andy Rubin\u2019s Essential PH-1 I bought used off of Amazon cheap. It\u2019s unrooted, runs native OpenCV and has tons of sensors to support cool machine vision/learning applications. By this time next year people will literally be throwing away their 2018 Android models to get a 2019 model. Most of those old models have USB type-C. We can get them cheap and turn them into full-tilt controllers for boss robots!\n\n\nThing 2:\n a control program running at Google Compute. The motor\u2019s behavior is not local - it\u2019s coming from a container running 1000km away in Oregon. At some point I\u2019ll support Amazon/AWS containers as well.\n\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d you say...\n\n\nThe idea is that robot behaviors run entirely in the cloud. Doing this we can make them inherently communal so that others can remix and improve the best stuff, just like MIT's Scratch. I also plan to have an IDE cohabitate the container alongside the robot\u2019s control app. This way you can dev/debug your robot live \u201cen situ.\u201d The container will spin up with everything it needs so you won\u2019t have to install dev tools - ever. This makes it easier for normal people to build and test their own robot. Tho\u2019 it will require me to bend Codenvy/Eclipse-CHE to my will. Which, btw, \nCodenvy\n, this is something every cloud day-job person wants too. It\u2019s silly that we dev/test on laptops and then shoehorn that into a cloud-based container. Idk, maybe Jetbrains gets there first and turns \nhttp://try.kotl.in/\n into a real IDE that cohabitates a Kotlin app\u2019s container. IntelliJ is great, but the world has changed entirely to cloud. There\u2019s no value in sticking with misfit tooling leftover from a desktop dev era.\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nI need to turn that tangle of wires into a single board that mounts to the back of the motor. Over the coming months I will use Autodesk EagleCAD to do that work, and I will share my progress. When it\u2019s done, we should be able to get it off the bench and make something like a simple cartbot.\n\n\nThe whole thing is BSD-3 licensed - hardware and software. The goal is that motor makers will adopt, copy and improve my work. In a year or so, we should be able to click, click, click, and a box shows up that contains cheap parts to make our own industrial strength robots that implement behaviors shared from the work of others.\n\n\nFor the time being, these are toys - messy, hilarious, fun and frustrating.\n\n\nhttps://blog.ycombinator.com/why-toys/\n \n\n\nSo\u2026 let\u2019s play!\n\n\n\u200b   -- other real jeff",
